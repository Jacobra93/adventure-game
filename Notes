You're off to a good start.. Some things you'll want to do going forward.

1) Put your classes into packages. Best practice is to use a unique domain name. Because you have a Github account,
you can use the 'github.com/jacobra93' domain because it is unique to you. That is why I created the package
'com.github.jacobra93'. No one else *should* use that package because it is unique to you.

2) Use enums. There are/were a lot of 'magic Strings' in this code. Generally you want to avoid using strings for
comparison operations. Using enums makes it much easier to navigate a code-base and refactor things.

3) Follow the 'single-responsibility' principle. Each class should do only one thing.

4) Remove project files from source-control (Github). I added a .gitignore file to help with this.

5) Let me know if you have other questions.
